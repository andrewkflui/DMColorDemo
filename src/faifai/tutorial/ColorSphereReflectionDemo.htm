<h2>Colour Plane Reflection Demo</h2>
    
<p>Learning objectives: to describe the colour reflected off an object of different
  colours when different colours of light is shining upon it.</p>
    
<p>The object can now be any colour. A coloured object means that the colour is
  what would be reflected off the object. In other words, the colour is not absorbed
  by the object.</p>
<p>A object with a white surface means that the object looks white when it is
  shone upon by white light. A white object does not absorb any colour of light.
</p>
<p>A red object will reflect red when shone upon by a white light. White light
  contains red component and only the red component is reflected. The other colour 
  components are absorbed.</p>
<p>However, a red object will reflect nothing when shone upon by a green light.
  Green light contains no red component and so nothing is reflected.</p>
