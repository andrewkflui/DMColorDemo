<h2>Colour Mix Light Demo</h2>
    
<p>Learning objectives: to describe the addition effect of shining two light rays 
  of different colours onto a white reflector</p>
    
<p>A white reflector reflects every colour components of light and so this is 
  an ideal medium for mixing light and seeing the effect.</p>
<p>A white light is made up of red, green, and blue components. So if we mix the 
  same amount of red light, green light, and blue light, we can get white light. 
  This learning demo allows you to mix light of different colours and see the 
  effect. </p>
