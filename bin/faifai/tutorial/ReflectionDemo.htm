    <h2>Colour Reflection Demo</h2>
    <p>Learning objectives: to describe the colour reflected off a 'white'
    plane when different colours of light is shining upon it.</p>
    <p>
      A plane with a white surface means that the plane looks white when
      it is shone upon by white light.  A white surface does not absorb any
      colour of light.
    </p>
    <p>The white plane is near the bottom of the screen</p>
    <p>The point light source is to the top hand side of the plane</p>
    <p>Change the colour of the light source and the light reflected off the plane is
the same as the light source</p>
